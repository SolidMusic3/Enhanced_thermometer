This is a project  of a device, that displays tempatures of CPU, GPU, and an external thermometer.
It uses:
- Windows 10 (other versions might work too)
- arduino nano
- BMP280 (I2c thermometer)
- 16x2 lcd
- pytho 3.8

file main.py has some instructions at the end, that you will have to follow in order to proceed.
To run the script in the background, you can run in with pythonw.exe.
To run it on startup, change the suffic of main.py to something else (example main.py -> main.tralala), create a shortcut and paste the shortcut in the startup folder
(to acces the startup folder press [windows key + R] and write: shell:startup )
good luck!
